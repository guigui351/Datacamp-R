# Mutating Joins
***  

## Welcome to the course!

* Advantages to `dplyr` over base R `merge` function for joing data
    + dplyr always preserves the row order
    + dplyr has much more intuitive syntax
    + dplyr can be applied to databases, or spark  
* dplyr is a front end language for maniulating data that can be converted to multiple backends like SQL or spark. 
    + This is pretty useful. Everything we cover in this class could work on a spark dataframe or a sql table
  
##Keys  

* The Primary key needs to be unique in a table  
* The foreign key in the second table can be duplicated  
* second table will be matched to the primary table based on the primary key  
* The primary key may be one, two or even more columns in the table  

###Primary Keys  

* What is the primary key in artists dataset?  
    + `name`  
  
```{r}
artists0 %>% 
  head(10) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left", font_size = 11) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#3f7689")
```
  

###Secondary Keys  

* Which datasets have a primary key that matches artists$name?  
    + `bands$name`  
    + `songs$writer`  

```{r}
albums0 %>% 
  head(10) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left", font_size = 11) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#3f7689")
  
bands0 %>% 
  head(10) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left", font_size = 11) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#3f7689")
  
songs0 %>% 
  head(10) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left", font_size = 11) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#3f7689")
```


###Multi-variable keys  

* What is the primary key in artists?  
    + The combination of `first` and `last`
    
```{r}
artists %>% 
  head(10) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left", font_size = 11) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#3f7689")
```

*The combination of first and last uniquely identifies each person in the dataset, just as the combination of first and last names tend to uniquely identify people in real life.*  

##Joins  

* Joins in dplyr will work on data frames, tibbles (tbl_df), and tbl references

###A basic join  

As Garrett mentioned in the video, `left_join()` is the basic join function in `dplyr`. You can use it whenever you want to augment a data frame with information from another data frame.

For example, `left_join(x, y)` joins `y` to `x`. The second dataset you specify is joined to the first dataset.   

```{r}
# Complete the code to join artists to bands
bands2 <- left_join(bands, artists, by = c('first','last'))

# Examine the results
bands2 %>% 
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left", font_size = 11) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#3f7689")
```

###A second join  

You should always check the output of your joins. Just because a join worked, doesn't mean that it worked as you expected.  

For example, the code in the editor joins the same two datasets that you joined in the previous exercise, but it returns a different result. Can you tell what went wrong?  

```{r}
left_join(bands, artists, by = "first") %>% 
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left", font_size = 11) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#3f7689")

# Fix the code to recreate bands3
left_join(bands, artists, by = c("first","last")) %>% 
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left", font_size = 11) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#3f7689")
```

* Notice how the `last` column is pulled in as `last.x` and `last.y` if not included in the join  
    + And how all combination of rows are created for each name that is duplicated, e.g. john  
    
* The easiest mistake when joining datasets is to use an incorrect combination of keys.  


###A right join  

There is more than one way to execute a left join. Knowing multiple methods will make you a more versatile data scientist, especially as you try to fit joins into pipes created with `%>%`.  

In this exercise, you'll recreate bands2 once more, but this time **without** using a `left_join()`.  

```{r}
# Finish the code below to recreate bands3 with a right join
bands2 <- left_join(bands, artists, by = c("first", "last"))
bands3 <- right_join(artists, bands, by = c("first", "last"))

# Check that bands3 is equal to bands2
setequal(bands2, bands3)
```

*`left_join()` is equivalent to `right_join()` with the order of the datasets reversed. Notice that each used the same `by` argument.*  

##Variations on joins  

  - `left_join` - prioritizes left dataset  
  - `right_join` - prioritizes right dataset  
  - `inner_join` - only retains rows in both datasets  
  - `full_join` - retains all rows  
  - Use `%>%` (pipes) to string together these joins  
  

###Inner joins and full joins  

You may have noticed that some of the `songs` in `songs` correspond to some of the `albums` in `albums`. Suppose you want a new dataset that contains all of the `songs` for which you have data from **both** `albums` and `songs`. How would you make it?  

The `artists` and `bands `datasets also share some information. What if you want to join these two datasets in such a way that you retain all of the information available in both tables, without throwing anything away?  

You can think of `inner joins` as the most strict type of join: they only retain observations that appear in both datasets. In contrast, `full joins` are the most permissive type of join: they return all of the data that appears in both datasets (often resulting in many missing values).  

Recall that, `*_join(x, y)` joins `y` to `x`. The second dataset you specify is joined to the first dataset.  

```{r}
# Join albums to songs using inner_join()
songs %>% 
  head() %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left", font_size = 11) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#3f7689")

albums %>% 
  head() %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left", font_size = 11) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#3f7689")

inner_join(songs, albums, by = "album") %>% 
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left", font_size = 11) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#3f7689")

# Join bands to artists using full_join()
artists %>% 
  head() %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left", font_size = 11) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#3f7689")

bands %>% 
  head() %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left", font_size = 11) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#3f7689")

full_join(artists, bands, by = c("first","last")) %>% 
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left", font_size = 11) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#3f7689")
```

###Pipes  

You can combine `dplyr` functions together with the pipe operator, `%>%`, to build up an analysis step-by-step. `%>%` takes the result of the code that comes before it and "pipes" it into the function that comes after it as the first argument of the function.  

So for example, the two pieces of code below do the same thing:  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
full_join(artists, bands, 
          by = c("first", "last")) %>% 
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left", font_size = 11) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#3f7689")

artists %>% 
  full_join(bands, by = c("first", "last"))
```

Pipes are so efficient for multi-step analysis that you will use them for the remainder of the exercises in this course.   

```{r}
# Find guitarists in bands dataset (don't change)
temp <- left_join(bands, artists, by = c("first", "last"))
temp <- filter(temp, instrument == "Guitar")
select(temp, first, last, band)

# Reproduce code above using pipes
bands %>% 
  left_join(artists, by = c("first", "last")) %>%
  filter(instrument == "Guitar") %>%
  select(first, last, band)
```


###Practice with pipes and joins  

We've created a data frame for you called `goal`. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to create a dataset that's identical to `goal`.  

```{r}
# Examine the contents of the goal dataset
goal %>% 
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left", font_size = 11) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#3f7689")

# Create goal2 using full_join() and inner_join() 
goal2 <- artists %>%
  full_join(bands, by = c("first","last")) %>%
  inner_join(songs, by = c("first","last"))
  
  
# Check that goal and goal2 are the same
setequal(goal, goal2)
```

*Remember that the order of the joins in your pipe determines the output of the pipe.*  


###Choose your joins  

You're getting the hang of pipes now! They are a very useful way to combine multiple joins to make a single dataset.  

```{r}
# Create one table that combines all information
artists %>%
  full_join(bands, by = c("first","last")) %>%
  full_join(songs, by = c("first","last")) %>%
  full_join(albums, by = c("album", "band")) %>% 
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left", font_size = 11) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#3f7689")
```
